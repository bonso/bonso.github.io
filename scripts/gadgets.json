        "description": "I had the option to upgrade phones and switch carriers back in June, and I took full advantage of it by switching to Verizon and getting a Windows Phone. I'm gonna be honest, I've actually liked it way more than I thought I would, but unfortunately it's really worn thin on me over the past month or so. The app selection is pitiful (no Google anything, no Imgur, etc.), and I've just gotten rather bored with it. <br><br>
        When I signed up with Verizon, I got an Edge contract that lets me upgrade early if I pay off 60% of my current phone. That just so happens to be a reasonable dollar amount, so I've decided that this is probably the one thing that I want most of all this year. I'm not exactly sure which phone I want, and believe it or not, an iPhone actually might be on the list. A high-end Android phone would likely also be desirable.<br><br>
        The tough thing about this is that there's really no way to make this a surprise. The phone and plan are under my name only, so to go through with this, I'd basically have to get my own present for myself. I'm not necessarily opposed to that, however, I'm just saying it might feel a bit lame. I'm sure there might be a way around it, such as just having me give permission to activate my new phone on Christmas Day, and not telling me exactly which phone it is that I'm getting. I don't really know. Regardless, this is still probably what I want the most this year, so I'm willing to make something work."
